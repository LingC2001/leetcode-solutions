title: 239. Sliding Window Maximum
difficulty: hard
tags: [sliding-window, deque]

import Code from '@/components/Code';

## Problem Statement

Given the following problem, find the optimal solution.

Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum value in every contiguous subarray of size `k`.

---

## Approach

Uses a **double ended queue (deque)** to track potential maximums in each window:

* Maintain a deque (`max_deque`) where elements are in decreasing order.
* For each new element:
  * Remove smaller elements from the back.
  * Append the new element.
* The front of the deque is always the current window's maximum.
* If the outgoing element equals the deque front, pop it.

This ensures we get O(1) access to the max for each window while keeping all operations efficient.
