title: 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
difficulty: medium
tags: [sliding-window, strings, hashing]

import Code from '@/components/Code';

## Problem Statement

Given the following problem, find the optimal solution.

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operation.

## Approach

The solution uses a **Sliding Window Strategy**:

* Use a window defined by `left` and `right` pointers to scan the string.
* Maintain a frequency map of characters within the current window.
* Track the count of the most frequent character in the window.
* If the number of characters to replace (window size - max frequency) exceeds `k`, shrink the window from the left.
    *   The max frequency determines the length of the window.
    *    We do not update max frequency if the new max is lower because we dont need to check windows that are smaller than the max length we have currently found.
* The maximum window size seen during this process is the result.

This approach ensures the substring always requires at most `k` replacements to be uniform.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** ** O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice.

**Space Complexity:** ** O(1), since the character set is limited to 26 uppercase English letters.
