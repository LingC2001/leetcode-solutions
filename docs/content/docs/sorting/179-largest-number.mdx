## Problem Statement

Given a list of non-negative integers `nums`, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it as a string. Since the result may be very large, return it as a string instead of an integer.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [10, 2]
Output: "210"
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]
Output: "9534330"
```

## Approach

The key insight: to decide which number should come first, compare the two multi-digit concatenations `a+b` vs `b+a` (as strings).

1. Convert all integers to strings.
2. Sort using the custom comparator: prefer `a` before `b` if `b+a > a+b` (descending order).
3. Join the sorted strings.
4. Edge case: if the largest element is `"0"`, return `"0"` (handles `[0, 0]`).

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n · k · log n), where k is the average string length. The comparator is O(k) and runs O(n log n) times.

**Space Complexity:** O(n · k) for the string representations.

## Key Insights

- The concatenation comparator `b+a > a+b` defines a valid total order, enabling standard sort algorithms.
- This is a greedy approach: locally choosing the better-positioned pair globally maximizes the number.
- The all-zeros edge case (`[0, 0, 0]`) must be handled — after sorting the first element is `"0"`, so return `"0"`.
