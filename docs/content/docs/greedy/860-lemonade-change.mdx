import Code from '@/components/Code';

## Problem Statement

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs `$5`. Customers pay with `$5`, `$10`, or `$20` bills. You start with no change. Return `true` if you can provide correct change to every customer, otherwise return `false`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: bills = [5, 5, 5, 10, 20]
Output: true
Explanation: From the first 3 customers collect $5 bills. Then give a $5 bill for the $10 customer. Finally give a $10 and $5 for the $20 customer.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: bills = [5, 5, 10, 10, 20]
Output: false
Explanation: For the last $20 bill, we need $15 change but only have two $10 bills.
```

## Approach

Greedy: Always give back the **largest denomination first** when making change for a $20 bill, because $5 bills are the most versatile (needed for both $10 and $20 change).

- Track counts of `$5` and `$10` bills held.
- For a `$5` bill: gain one `$5`.
- For a `$10` bill: give one `$5`, gain one `$10`.
- For a `$20` bill: prefer to give one `$10` + one `$5`; if no `$10` available, give three `$5`s.
- If at any point a required denomination is unavailable, return `false`.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of customers.

**Space Complexity:** O(1).

## Key Insights

- The greedy choice is to use a `$10` bill when giving change for `$20` — `$5` bills are more versatile and should be conserved.
- Only `$5` and `$10` bills need to be tracked; `$20` bills can never be given as change.
- Early return on the first failure avoids unnecessary iterations.
