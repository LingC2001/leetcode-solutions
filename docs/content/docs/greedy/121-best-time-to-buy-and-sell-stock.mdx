import Code from '@/components/Code';

## Problem Statement

Given the following problem, find the optimal solution.

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the i-th day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day to buy** one stock and choosing a **different day in the future to sell** that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If no profit is possible, return 0.

## Approach

The solution uses a **Single-Pass Greedy Strategy** to efficiently track the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit achievable at each step.

* Iterate through the price list while maintaining the lowest price encountered so far.
* At each step, calculate the profit if you were to sell at the current day's price.
* Continuously update the maximum profit found so far.
* Continuously update the minimum price if a lower price is encountered.

This approach guarantees that each day is processed only once, and ensures the "buy before sell" constraint is satisfied.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** ** O(n), where n is the number of days. Each price is processed once.

**Space Complexity:** ** O(1), using constant extra space for tracking variables.
