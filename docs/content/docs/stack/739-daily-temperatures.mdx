import Code from '@/components/Code';

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `temperatures` representing daily temperatures, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the number of days after day `i` until a warmer temperature. If there is no future warmer day, `answer[i] = 0`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
Output: [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: temperatures = [30, 40, 50, 60]
Output: [1, 1, 1, 0]
```

### Example 3

```
Input: temperatures = [30, 60, 90]
Output: [1, 1, 0]
```

## Approach

**Monotonic decreasing stack** (stores indices of unresolved days):

* Iterate left to right. For each day `i`:
  * While the stack is non-empty and `temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[-1]]`:
    * Pop index `j` from the stack.
    * Set `answer[j] = i - j`.
  * Push `i` onto the stack.
* Any indices remaining in the stack have no warmer future day → `answer[j] = 0` (default).

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — each index is pushed and popped at most once.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the stack and result array.

## Key Insights

- This is the classic **"next greater element"** pattern — a monotonic stack solves it in O(n).
- Store indices in the stack (not values) to compute the day difference directly.
- The stack maintains a decreasing order of temperatures; whenever a day is warmer, resolve all pending smaller days.
