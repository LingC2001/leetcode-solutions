## Problem Statement

Given the following problem, find the optimal solution.

Given an integer array `nums`, determine if any value appears at least twice in the array. Return `True` if any duplicates exist, otherwise return `False`.

---

## Approach

The solution uses a set to track unique elements encountered while iterating through the list. For each element:

- Check if it already exists in the set.
- If yes, return `True` immediately (duplicate found).
- Otherwise, add the element to the set and continue.

If the loop completes without finding duplicates, return `False`.

**Note:** Your current code has a logic error where `return False` is inside the loop, causing premature termination after the first element. It should be placed outside the loop to ensure the entire list is checked.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** ** O(n), where n is the length of `nums`. Each element is processed once.

**Space Complexity:** ** O(n), as a set is used to store unique elements.
