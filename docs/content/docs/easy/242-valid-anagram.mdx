## Problem Statement

Given the following problem, find the optimal solution.

Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if `t` is an anagram of `s`. An anagram means both strings contain the same characters with the same frequencies, but possibly in a different order.

---

## Approach

The solution uses a hash map (implemented as a `defaultdict(int)`) to count character frequencies in `s`. Then, it decrements counts based on characters in `t`. If after processing both strings any character count is not zero, the strings are not anagrams.

- Count frequencies of each character in `s`.
- Subtract frequencies based on characters in `t`.
- If any count is non-zero, return `False`.
- Otherwise, return `True`.

This approach efficiently compares the two strings using character counts without sorting.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** ** O(n), where n is the length of the strings (both are assumed to be the same length for an anagram).

**Space Complexity:** ** O(1), since the character set is fixed (e.g., ASCII alphabets), or O(k) where k is number of unique characters.
