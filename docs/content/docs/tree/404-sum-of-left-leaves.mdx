title: 404. Sum of Left Leaves

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all **left leaves**. A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of its parent.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: root = [3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]
Output: 24
Explanation: Left leaves are 9 and 15 → 9 + 15 = 24.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
```

## Approach

DFS with a `leftChild` boolean flag:

1. Pass `isLeft bool` down the recursion to indicate whether the current node is a left child.
2. If the current node is a leaf **and** `isLeft == true`, add its value to the sum.
3. Recurse left with `isLeft = true` and right with `isLeft = false`.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes. Each node is visited once.

**Space Complexity:** O(h), where h is the height of the tree, for the recursion stack.

## Key Insights

- The "left" designation must come from the parent — a leaf node alone cannot determine if it's a left child.
- Pass the `isLeft` flag as a parameter rather than checking parent pointers (which linked structures don't usually have).
- This pattern generalizes to any problem where node identity depends on position relative to its parent.
