title: 404. Sum of Left Leaves

import Code from '@/components/Code';

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves in the tree.

A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf node that is the left child of its parent.

---

## Approach

Use DFS (Depth-First Search) with a flag to track whether the current node is a left child:

1. Pass a `leftChild` boolean flag from parent to child to indicate if the current node is a left child.
2. During traversal, recursively process left and right subtrees.
3. When we find a leaf node (no left or right child) that is also a left child (flag is true), add its value to the sum.
4. Return the accumulated sum.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - where n is the number of nodes. We visit each node once during the DFS traversal.

**Space Complexity:** O(h) - where h is the height of the tree. This is for the recursive call stack in the worst case (skewed tree).
