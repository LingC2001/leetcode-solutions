import Code from '@/components/Code';

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, you want to create an array `ans` of length `2n` where `ans[i] == nums[i]` and `ans[i + n] == nums[i]` for `0 <= i < n`. In other words, `ans` is the concatenation of two `nums` arrays. Return the array `ans`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 1]
Output: [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [1, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1]
```

## Approach

Allocate an output array of size `2n` and fill it by copying each element `nums[i]` into both `ans[i]` and `ans[i + n]`. This can be done in a single pass.

---

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of `nums`.

**Space Complexity:** O(n), for the output array (not counting the required output).

## Key Insights

- Pre-allocate the result array of size `2n` and use index arithmetic — no need for two separate loops.
- In Go, `make([]int, 2*n)` allocates with zero values; then `ans[i]` and `ans[i+n]` are set in one pass.
- Most languages also support simple array concatenation: `nums + nums`.
