## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, determine if any value appears at least twice in the array. Return `true` if any duplicates exist, otherwise return `false`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
Output: true
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: false
```

### Example 3

```
Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2]
Output: true
```

## Approach

The solution uses a set to track unique elements encountered while iterating through the list. For each element:
- Check if it already exists in the set.
- If yes, return `true` immediately (duplicate found).
- Otherwise, add the element to the set and continue.

If the loop completes without finding duplicates, return `false`.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of `nums`. Each element is processed once.

**Space Complexity:** O(n), as a set is used to store unique elements.

## Key Insights

- A set provides O(1) average lookup, making it ideal for duplicate detection.
- Early return on the first duplicate avoids unnecessary iterations.
- Alternatively, sorting the array (O(n log n)) and checking adjacent elements uses O(1) space.
