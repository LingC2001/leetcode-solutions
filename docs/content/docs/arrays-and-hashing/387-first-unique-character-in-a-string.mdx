## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return `-1`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
Explanation: The character 'l' at index 0 appears only once.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The character 'v' at index 2 appears only once.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1
```

## Approach

Use a two-pass approach:

1. **First Pass**: Iterate through the string and count the frequency of each character using a hash map.
2. **Second Pass**: Iterate through the string again and return the index of the first character with a frequency of 1.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string. We iterate twice.

**Space Complexity:** O(1), since at most 26 lowercase English letters are tracked.

## Key Insights

- Two passes are required: one to count frequencies, one to find the first unique character in original order.
- A single-pass approach is possible using a list of `(char, index)` ordered by first occurrence, but the two-pass approach is simpler.
- Since the alphabet is fixed (26 letters), space is effectively constant.
