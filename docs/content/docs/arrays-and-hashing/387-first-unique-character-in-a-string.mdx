title: 387. First Unique Character in a String

import Code from '@/components/Code';

## Problem Statement

Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If the string does not contain a unique character, return -1.

---

## Approach

Use a two-pass approach:

1. **First Pass**: Iterate through the string and count the frequency of each character using a hash map.
2. **Second Pass**: Iterate through the string again and return the index of the first character with a frequency of 1.

This approach is optimal because it processes the string in linear time while keeping track of character frequencies.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - where n is the length of the string. We iterate through the string twice.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use a fixed-size hash map with at most 26 entries (for lowercase English letters), which is considered constant space.
