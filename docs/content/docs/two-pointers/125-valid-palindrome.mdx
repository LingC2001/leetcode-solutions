import Code from '@/components/Code';

## Problem Statement

Given the following problem, find the optimal solution.

Given a string `s`, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

---

## Approach

The approach first preprocesses the input string by converting it to lowercase and filtering out all non-alphanumeric characters, creating a sanitized string `stripped_str`. Then, two pointers `forward_index` and `backward_index` are used to compare characters from the start and end of the string moving inward.

- If characters at both pointers match, pointers move closer to the center.
- If a mismatch is found, return `False` immediately.
- If pointers cross without mismatches, return `True`.

This method efficiently checks palindrome property by ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** ** O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. The string is processed twice (filtering and checking), both linear operations.

**Space Complexity:** ** O(n), due to the creation of the filtered string.
