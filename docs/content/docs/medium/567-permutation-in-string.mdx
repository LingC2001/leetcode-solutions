title: 567. Permutation in String
---

import Code from '@/components/Code';

## Problem Statement

Given the following problem, find the optimal solution.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return `true` if `s2` contains a **permutation** of `s1`, otherwise return `false`.

---

## Approach

Uses a **fixed-size sliding window** and character frequency dictionaries:

* If `len(s1) > len(s2)`, return `False`.
* Create frequency maps for `s1` and the first window in `s2`.
* Slide the window across `s2`, updating the map:
  * Add the new character, remove the old one.
  * Clean up 0-count entries to match dictionary structure.
  * Compare maps — if equal, return `True`.
* Return `False` if no match found.

### 💡 Why direct dict comparison works:

A permutation has the same character counts. Zero-count entries are removed to avoid mismatches from extra keys.
