## Problem Statement

Given the following problem, find the optimal solution.

Given a 1-indexed array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2.

## Approach

The solution uses the two-pointer technique, leveraging the sorted property of the input array:

- Initialize two pointers: `lower_index` at the start and `higher_index` at the end.
- Calculate the sum of elements at both pointers.
- If the sum is greater than the target, decrement the higher pointer to reduce the sum.
- If the sum is less than the target, increment the lower pointer to increase the sum.
- If the sum equals the target, return the 1-based indices.
- This approach efficiently finds the pair in a single pass.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** ** O(n), where n is the length of the input list. Each element is visited at most once.

**Space Complexity:** ** O(1), as only pointers and variables are used, no extra space proportional to input size.
