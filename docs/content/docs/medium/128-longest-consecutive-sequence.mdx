title: 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
---

import Code from '@/components/Code';

## Problem Statement

Given the following problem, find the optimal solution.

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

---

## Approach

The solution uses a set for O(1) lookups and identifies the start of a consecutive sequence by checking if the previous number `(n - 1)` is not in the set. For each sequence start, it counts the length of consecutive numbers by incrementing from `n` until the sequence ends.

- Convert the list to a set for fast membership testing.
- Iterate over the set:
  - For each number, check if it is the start of a sequence.
  - If yes, count consecutive numbers incrementally.
- Track and update the maximum sequence length found.
- Return the maximum length after processing all numbers.

This approach avoids sorting and achieves linear time complexity.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** ** O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`. Each element is processed at most twice.

**Space Complexity:** ** O(n), used by the set to store the elements.
