## Problem Statement

Given the following problem, find the optimal solution.

Given a list of daily temperatures, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature.
If there is no future day for which this is possible, put `0` instead.

## Approach

This problem is a variation of the "next greater element" pattern, where we need to determine how far ahead in the list a warmer temperature occurs for each day. A **monotonic decreasing stack** is well-suited for this type of problem.

* Iterate through the list of temperatures from left to right.
* Use a stack to store indices of unresolved days in decreasing order of their temperatures.
* For each day:

  * While the current temperature is greater than the temperature at the top of the stack:

    * Pop the index from the stack.
    * Calculate the number of days waited as the difference between current and popped indices.
    * Store the result at the popped index.
* Push the current index onto the stack.
* After processing, the remaining indices in the stack do not have a warmer future day, so their result remains `0`.

### Why this works:

* The stack tracks days waiting for a warmer temperature in an efficient, non-redundant way.
* Each day’s index is pushed and popped at most once, ensuring linear time complexity.
* This approach avoids brute-force nested comparisons and is scalable for large inputs.

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** ** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. Each index is pushed and popped at most once.

**Space Complexity:** ** O(n), for the result list and the stack used to store unresolved indices.
