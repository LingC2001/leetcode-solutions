title: 875. Koko Eating Bananas
---

import Code from '@/components/Code';

## Problem Statement

Given the following problem, find the optimal solution.

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, where the `i`-th pile has `piles[i]` bananas. Guards leave for `h` hours, and during this time, Koko wants to eat all the bananas. Koko can decide her eating speed `k` (bananas per hour). Each hour, she chooses exactly one pile and eats `k` bananas from it. If the pile has fewer than `k` bananas, she eats all of them and stops eating for that hour. Koko wants to finish all the piles within `h` hours.  

Return the minimum integer `k` such that she can eat all the bananas in at most `h` hours.

## Approach

We use a **Binary Search** on the eating speed `k`:

1. **Search Space**  
   - Minimum possible speed is `1`.  
   - Maximum possible speed is `max(piles)` (eat the largest pile in one hour).

2. **Feasibility Check**  
   - For a candidate speed `mid`, compute the total hours needed:  
     hours = sum( ceil(pile / mid) for each pile ).  
   - If `hours <= h`, Koko can finish in time with speed `mid` (store it as a potential answer and try to lower `mid`).  
   - If `hours > h`, speed `mid` is too slow, so increase `mid`.

3. **Binary Search Loop**  
   - Initialize `left = 1`, `right = max(piles)`, `ans = right`.  
   - While `left <= right`:  
     - `mid = (left + right) // 2`  
     - Compute `hours_taken`.  
     - If `hours_taken > h`, set `left = mid + 1`.  
     - Else, set `ans = mid` (record valid speed) and `right = mid - 1`.  
   - Return `ans`.

This yields the minimum valid eating speed in O(n · log m), where n = number of piles and m = max pile size.
